.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Use the \fIipa-acme-manage\fR command to enable, disable or retrieve
the status of the ACME service on a IPA CA server.

In a IPA topology all CA servers capable of ACME will
have the ACME service deployed.  The service is not enabled
by default.  It is expected that the ACME service will either be
enabled on all CA servers, or disabled on all CA servers.  However
it must be enabled or disabled on each individual server.

.SH "COMMANDS"

\fBenable\fR

\fBdisable\fR

.TP
\fBstatus\fR
Display the status of the ACME service.

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
0 if the command was successful

3 if the host is not a CA server
