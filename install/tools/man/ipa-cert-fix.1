.SH "NAME"
ipa\-cert\-fix \- Renew expired certificates
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
ipa\-cert\-fix [options]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

\fIipa-cert-fix\fR is a tool for recovery when expired certificates
prevent the normal operation of IPA.  It should ONLY be used in
such scenarios, and backup of the system, especially certificates
and keys, is \fBSTRONGLY RECOMMENDED\fR.

Do not use this program unless expired certificates are inhibiting
normal operation and renewal procedures.

To renew the IPA CA certificate, use \fIipa-cacert-manage(1)\fR.

This tool cannot renew certificates signed by external CAs.  To
install new, externally-signed HTTP, LDAP or KDC certificates, use
\fIipa-server-certinstall(1)\fR.

\fIipa-cert-fix\fR will examine IPA and Certificate System
certificates and renew certificates that are expired, or close to
expiry (less than two weeks).  If any "shared" certificates are
renewed, \fIipa-cert-fix\fR will set the current server to be the CA
renewal master, and add the new shared certificate(s) to LDAP for
replication to other CA servers.  Shared certificates include all
Dogtag system certificates except the HTTPS certificate, and the IPA
RA certificate.

To repair certificates across multiple CA servers, first ensure that
LDAP replication is working across the topology.  Then run
\fIipa-cert-fix\fR on one CA server.  Before running
\fIipa-cert-fix\fR on another CA server, trigger Certmonger renewals
for shared certificates via \fIgetcert-resubmit(1)\fR (on the other
CA server).  This is to avoid unnecessary renewal of shared
certificates.
