===================================

What is FreeIPA?
----------------

FreeIPA is an integrated security information management solution combining
Linux (Fedora), 389 Directory Server, MIT Kerberos, DNS, Dogtag
(Certificate System). It consists of a web interface and command-line
administration tools.

FreeIPA is an integrated Identity and Authentication solution for
Linux/UNIX networked environments. A FreeIPA server provides centralized
authentication, authorization and account information by storing data about
user, groups, hosts and other objects necessary to manage the security
aspects of a network of computers.

FreeIPA is built on top of well known Open Source components and standard
protocols with a very strong focus on ease of management and automation of
installation and configuration tasks.
